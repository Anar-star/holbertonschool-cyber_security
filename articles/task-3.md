Secure by Design – Security by Design Principle
The Secure by Design principle does not mean adding security later, but rather building security mechanisms into the system and software from the initial design stage. This approach is a proactive rather than reactive security strategy.
Threat modeling, the principle of minimal function, and secure default settings play a key role within this principle. When Secure by Design is applied, the number of vulnerabilities is reduced, security costs are reduced, and user trust is strengthened.
The application of this approach in software development and system architecture is carried out in CI/CD environments with automated security tests, code analysis, and continuous control mechanisms. This principle is a basic condition for modern technological solutions to be stable, reliable, and secure.
