Security Through Obscurity – The Principle of Security Through Obscurity
The principle of Security Through Obscurity involves ensuring security by keeping system details, configurations, and internal mechanisms secret. This approach is considered one of the controversial topics among cybersecurity experts, as it is not considered a reliable defense mechanism on its own.
In some cases, hiding the system architecture, ports, or logic flow can make it difficult for attackers to do their job. However, relying on this method alone is dangerous, because in the event of a data leak or system analysis, the entire defense mechanism can be weakened.
For this reason, Security Through Obscurity should only be applied as an additional layer of protection, as part of a Defense in Depth strategy. When used in conjunction with transparent security mechanisms, audits, and open standards, this approach can increase the overall level of security, but should never be the main defense method.
