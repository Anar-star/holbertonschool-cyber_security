Separation of Duties (SoD) – Principle of Separation of Duties
The principle of Separation of Duties (SoD) involves the distribution of critical tasks and authorities among several people or systems in order to increase security. This approach helps prevent both intentional abuse and accidental errors.
This principle has its roots in financial control systems and has become one of the main control mechanisms in the field of cybersecurity over time. When SoD is applied, insider threats are reduced, the division of responsibilities is clarified, and the reliability of operations is increased.
In the IT environment, SoD is widely used, especially in system administration, change management, and incident response processes. For example, when the person making a change to the system and the person approving it are different, the level of security increases significantly. This principle is an important component of a sustainable and reliable security strategy in modern organizations.
