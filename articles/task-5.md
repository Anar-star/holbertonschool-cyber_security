Synthesis of Security Principles – Building a Unified Strategy
The principles discussed in this blog series, Defense in Depth, Least Privilege, Separation of Duties, Secure by Design, and Security Through Obscurity, when applied together, form a strong and sustainable cybersecurity strategy. Each principle covers a different aspect of security and complements the overall defense mechanism.
These approaches are mutually supportive: multi-layered defenses protect a broad attack surface, minimal separation of powers and duties reduces internal risks, security by design prevents the creation of security gaps, and confidentiality provides an additional layer of protection. When applied together, these principles create a complex and agile security environment.
Building a unified security strategy is not only possible with technology, but also with organizational culture, policies, and continuous development. In the future, against the backdrop of increasing AI-based attacks and automated threats, these principles will become even more important.
Every organization should re-evaluate its security approach based on these principles and form a holistic, sustainable, and proactive security model.
