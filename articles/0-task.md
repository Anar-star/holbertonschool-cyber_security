Defense in Depth – Multi-Layered Defense Principle
Defense in Depth is one of the main principles in cybersecurity and refers to the fact that security is based not on a single mechanism, but on multiple layers of defense that complement each other. This approach is more effective in preventing possible attacks by ensuring protection of the system at different levels.
This concept has its roots in military strategies and has been adapted to information technologies over time. In modern times, it is applied as a comprehensive security strategy that covers the network, system, application, data and human factors.
The Defense in Depth model creates a stable and reliable cyber defense environment by combining physical security, technical control mechanisms, administrative rules and user education. This approach is especially critical for technology-oriented companies and forms the basis of a strong security system.
